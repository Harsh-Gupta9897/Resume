## ML Projects

### Deep Learning (Computer Vision )

1. **VQVAE as a Defense Against Adversarial Attacks**
   - **Description:**
     - Explored the use of Variational Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) as a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks.
     - Investigated the effectiveness of VQVAE in enhancing robustness to adversarial examples generated by FGSM, I-FGSM, and MI-FGSM attacks.
     - Implemented and evaluated the defense-VAE approach inspired by the Defense-VAE paper to assess its performance against different attack scenarios.

2. **Human Motion Diffusion Model**
   - **Description:**
     - Developed a Human Motion Diffusion Model (simMDM) within 10 days based on the latest paper.
     - Utilized a different dataset and experimented with UNet-based architectures to study their impact on generating dance videos from keypoints provided in JSON format.
     - Investigated motion diffusion models and their variations to simulate natural human movement sequences.

3. **Virtual Cloth TryON (Person Image Synthesis)**
   - **Description:**
     - Explored various GANs for cloth and pose synthesis and human generation in that pose.
     - Investigated DCGAN and StyleGAN Encoder Variation for cloth virtual try-on applications.
     - Explored and learn about different possible architecture for cloth tryon based on pose and garment. 
     - Tryout different diffusion and GAN architecture such as PIDM , StyleGAN2 , cvton and also proposed new GAN architecture based on pix2pix to solve the problem.

4. **DCGAN with ADAIN and ViT Implementation from Scratch**
   - **Description:**
     - Conducted an in-depth analysis and implemented the Vision Transformer (ViT) and DCGAN with AdaIN (Adaptive Instance Normalization) from scratch.
     - Examined the architectures' performance on the CIFAR100 dataset to understand their working and capabilities for image generation and classification tasks.
     - All implementations were done in PyTorch based on the nn module, ensuring a solid understanding of the underlying concepts.
